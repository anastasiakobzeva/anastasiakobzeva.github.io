**Job opportunity announcement:** I am looking to transition from academia to industry and seeking positions within analytics, data science, and/or natural language processing (NLP) in and around Oslo. I have a strong foundation in NLP, data handling, statistical analysis, data visualization, and experimental
research design. I am eager to apply these skills to real-world scenarios and tasks.

I am a PhD Candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), supervised by [Dave Kush](https://davewkush.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net/). I am affiliated with the [Ã˜y(e)lab/EyeLands Lab](https://davewkush.github.io/oeyelab.html) and the [FORMAAL research group](https://www.ntnu.edu/isl/formaal) at NTNU. 

I have submitted my PhD thesis in Computational Psycholinguistics for evaluation at NTNU, where I worked at the intersection of Language Acquisition, Computational Linguistics, and Experimental Syntax. For my PhD-project, I conducted behavioral experiments and trained several statistical and neural language models to explore their ability to learn a specific linguistic phenomenon in Norwegian (filler-gap dependencies and island constraints on them). My dissertation explored what these models and their successes and failures can reveal about the nature of human language learning and the input data which humans and models learn from. 

I hold a joint Research Master's degree in Clinical Linguistics ([EMCL+](https://emcl.eu/)) and a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics from NRU HSE. Apart from the PhD, my research experience includes working as a research assistant at the [Center for Language and Brain](https://www.hse.ru/en/neuroling/) at NRU HSE and the Eye-Tracking and Language Processing Lab at CUNY. In my research, I am committed to adhering to open science practices.

In my free time, I volunteer at [ReStore](https://www.rethinkrestore.no/) -- a student organization that works to reduce household waste by facilitating the reuse of goods in Trondheim. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, baking sourdough bread, and playing board games.
